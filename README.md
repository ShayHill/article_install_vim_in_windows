# Introduction

The traditional ethos of Vim has been "Vim is my text editor; my OS is my IDE", meaning Vim users would write or edit a program in Vim then use git, grep, sed, awk, find, build, etc., etc., etc. through each application's command-line interface instead of a graphical *interface to an interface* built into an IDE.

This isn't enforced. Some *interfaces to interfaces* have been built into Vim over the years, and others have become popular through plugins, but the *interfaces to interfaces* are generally much thinner that what you'd find in an IDE. If asked, "How do you commit and push your changes in Vim?", most Vim users would say, "I don't".

This ethos is a little more straightforward in Linux, because Linux typically comes with pre-installed *git, grep, sed, awk, find, build, etc., etc., etc.*. Windows does not.

At the same time, the ethos has expanded to "Vim is my text editor; my OS *and various APIs* are my IDE", because a lot of us want LSPs and AI. The Vim community have written *interfaces to APIs* as plugins, and they have reduced the complexity as far as reasonably possible, but you will have to do a small bit of configuration.

In truth, you'll have to do "a small bit of configuration" in any editor or IDE. At some point, and it won't be long, you will have to hack through json files and dig through menus and fall back to native interfaces for missing *interface-to-interface* features. The difference in Vim is that you'll have to do more of it up front.

There's nothing difficult about putting this all together, but there are a few pitfalls and "unknown unknowns" if you haven't done it before. This guide will start from a stock Windows 11 install and take you all the way to a Python development environment with completion, snippets, LSPs, debugging, AI, etc. The end result will be heavy in features, but light in customization. From there, you can start exploring.

## copy and paste

There is a lot of code in this guide that you may wish to copy and paste into your Vim files. If you are very new to Vim, this is how you copy to and from the Windows clipboard:

- Select text then `"+y` to copy to the Windows clipboard.

- `"+p` to paste from the Windows clipboard.

So, to copy code from this guide, just copy the code in Windows, then enter Normal mode (press `<ESC>`) then `"+p` to paste the code into Vim.

# Install Vim

This is an obvious first step, and it's an easy one, because we're not going to compile Vim. But there are some tricks if you aren't familiar with Windows.

Go to [Releases · vim/vim-win32-installer (github.com)](https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases), download the exe file for your architecture (32 or 64 bit), run it, and accept all the defaults. This will add a few icons to your desktop that you probably don't want, but it's easy to delete them later. Elsewhere in this guide, we're going to use `winget`, but Vim itself suggests downloading and installing from GitHub.

The installer will not add `vim` and `gvim` to your Path environment variable. You can alias them in PowerShell as shown in the [[Install Cross-Platform PowerShell]] section below or add them to your Path.

## Editing the Path Environment Variable

If you are completely unfamiliar with Windows, let's quickly go through this. You don't *have to* have Vim in your path, you could just use shell aliases. But if you'd like to have vim and gvim in your path, there are multiple ways to do it. I'll describe two. I prefer Option Two, because there's less room for error, and you'll probably end up there eventually to clean up mistakes made with Option One. Option One is for people who wish to script their entire device configuration.

### Option One, Command Line

Open PowerShell and enter (If you've installed Vim91)

```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", "$($env:PATH);C:\Program Files\Vim\vim91", [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::User)
```

### Option Two, GUI

- Press the Windows key

- Search for "Environment Variables" and click the "Best Match"

- This will bring up the System Properties dialog, which has a link, Environment Variables, near the lower-right corner. Click there.

- The "User variables for username" are in the top half of the Environment Variables dialog. For now, you're interested in the Path variable

- Double click the Path variable, and make sure you see the path to your current Vim installation.

- If not, click "Edit" then "Browse" then navigate to `C:\Program Files\Vim\vim91` (or whatever the current version is) to add it.

### Some Nuance with Environment Variables

- Environment variables are read when applications are opened, so changes to environment variables will not take effect until you open a new window. There are other ways, but that's the easy way.

- You have to back out (click "OK") *twice*, going all the way back to the System Properties dialog, before the variable is actually changed. This one has gotten me many times.

## Create a Vimrc

If you open gVim now, you will have a fairly nice experience. Filetype detection and syntax highlighting will work, backspace will behave as you expect it to, and commands will autocomplete.

However, once you create your own configuration in

```
~\vimfiles\vimrc
```

Vim gets (arguably) worse! This is because [Bram Moolenaar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Moolenaar) and others configured some nice default behaviors in

```
C:\Program Files\Vim\vim91\defaults.vim
```

But these defaults aren't, strictly speaking, defaults, because this is not how Vim will look and behave with *no* configuration. When you create your own `vimrc` file, Vim reads *your* `vimrc` *instead of* `defaults.vim`, so you get true "out of the box" Vim behavior: no filetype detection, no syntax highlighting, and 1970s-style backspace behavior.

This is all we'll configure for now. Open gVim (not Vim itself. Wait until we have a better shell to run it in) from the Windows menu. Run this command:

```
:e ~\vimfiles\vimrc
```

and create a simple `vimrc` with this content:

```vim
vim9script

# nice defaults from Bram and the The Vim Project
source $VIMRUNTIME/defaults.vim
```

This will preserve the nice defaults. The `vim9script` is optional, but the rest of this guide will assume you have it set.

# Install Cross-Platform PowerShell

There are two versions of PowerShell: Windows PowerShell (blue icon) and cross-platform PowerShell (black icon). Windows comes with blue-icon PowerShell pre-installed, but if you open it, you will see a prompt to install cross-platform (black-icon) PowerShell.

Either ctrl-click the link in this prompt to [install the latest version of "PowerShell 7"](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/whats-new/migrating-from-windows-powershell-51-to-powershell-7?view=powershell-7.4) or run this command in blue-icon PowerShell

```powershell
winget install Microsoft.Powershell --source winget
```

If you install by downloading and running the executable, accept all the defaults.

Once installed, PowerShell 7 will be the default when you run Windows Terminal. You can run Windows Terminal by searching for it in the start menu or by holding the `windows key`, pressing `x`, then releasing both keys and pressing `i`. When I use the name "PowerShell" from here on, I am referring to cross-platform, black-icon, PowerShell 7.

If PowerShell 7 is not the default, or if you don't see black-icon PowerShell as a choice when adding a tab with the Windows Terminal down arrow in the tab bar, it's safe to go to

```
C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState
```

and delete `settings.json` and `state.json`. They will almost instantly regenerate, leaving your Windows Terminal in a default configuration (which should include PowerShell 7). Of course, you'll lose any configuration you've done, but it was probably broken anyway. Make a backup if you're worried about it.

## Configuration

If you don't already have a PowerShell config, create one by running

```powershell
new-item $profile -itemtype file
```

from PowerShell. This will create a PowerShell profile at

```
~\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
```

You may wish to add aliases as we go. For now, here is the format for those aliases:

```powershell
Set-Alias -Name black -Value 'C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\Scripts\black'
Set-Alias -Name isort -Value 'C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\Scripts\isort'
```

### Open a New PowerShell Tab in the Same Directory

When you open a new tab in PowerShell, that tab will be open to a system folder or your home directory, depending on how you have it configured. If you're working on a project in Vim, and you want to open a tab to run git or pre-commit or something else, then you probably want to open a new tab in the project directory.

[This page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/tutorials/new-tab-same-directory) explains how to configure PowerShell to open a new tab in the same directory as the current tab. It explains a few-dozen other approaches as well, so I'll excerpt the relevant information here.

Copy this code into your PowerShell profile:

```powershell
function prompt
{
  $loc = Get-Location
  $prompt = & $GitPromptScriptBlock
  $prompt += "$([char]27)]9;12$([char]7)"
  if ($loc.Provider.Name -eq "FileSystem")
  {
    $prompt += "$([char]27)]9;9;`"$($loc.ProviderPath)`"$([char]27)\"
  }
  $prompt
}
```

Now, close and reopen PowerShell, then press `Ctrl+Shift+D` (D for Duplicate) in PowerShell to to open a new tab in the same directory as the current tab.

### Tell Vim About PowerShell

Start PowerShell (`winkey-x` then `i`), open Vim inside PowerShell, then add this to `~vimfiles\vimrc`.

```vim
if has("windows")
	set shell=pwsh
endif
```

To let Vim know to open terminals in cross-platform PowerShell. The options `shell=pwsh` and `shell=powershell` are not the same. The latter is for Windows (blue-icon) PowerShell, which isn't a nice experience.

# Install Python

You can use winget or [Download Python | Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) executable files to install every version of Python you want to support. These are the supported versions of Python as I write this.

```powershell
winget install Python.Launcher --source winget
winget install Python.Python.3.8 --source winget
winget install Python.Python.3.9 --source winget
winget install Python.Python.3.10 --source winget
winget install Python.Python.3.11 --source winget
winget install Python.Python.3.12 --source winget
```

If you're installing using winget, also install the Python Launcher. If you're installing through the Python website, the executables will install the Python Launcher for you.

You may also want to install older versions, release candidates, or something else potentially not supported by Vim and it's plugins. **Don't do that yet!**

First, select a relatively new and stable version of Python—no prereleases and no "month-of" releases. Vim doesn't ship with it's own version of Python. Vim and it's plugins will try to use the newest version of Python you have. To avoid any problems, we'll tell Vim *which* version of Python we want to use. Open your `~vimfiles\vimrc` file and add the following (if your "relatively new and stable" version of Python is 3.11):

```vim
if has("windows")
	var local_programs = expand('$HOME/AppData/Local/Programs')
	execute 'set pythonthreehome=' .. local_programs .. "/Python/Python311"
	execute 'set pythonthreedll=' .. local_programs .. "/Python/Python311/python311.dll"
endif
```

From Vim, run the command `:py3 print("test")` to make sure you have it set up correctly.

You may find that Vim and all your plugins "just work" without setting `pythonthreehome` and `pythonthreedll`. Vim knows where to look for a typical Python install. However, that could break at any time if you install a version of Python that Vim or one of your plugins does not support.

As I write this, Python 13 is in prerelease, and Vim itself is not compatible. So not even `vim -u NONE` will get you past the errors. Go ahead and explicitly set these values in your vimrc.

---

**OK, NOW** install whatever exotic, specific, or decrepit versions of Python you'd like to have.

## The Python Launcher

If you install Python using winget, you will have a lot of new entries in your User Path environment variable.

```
C:\Users\shaya\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\Scripts\;
C:\Users\shaya\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\;
C:\Users\shaya\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\Scripts\;
C:\Users\shaya\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\;
C:\Users\shaya\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\Scripts\;
C:\Users\shaya\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\;
C:\Users\shaya\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\Scripts\;
C:\Users\shaya\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\;
C:\Users\shaya\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38\Scripts\;
C:\Users\shaya\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38\;
C:\Users\shaya\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Launcher\;
```

Each of the `Programs\Python3n\` paths will contain a `python.exe`.

- Running `python` from the command line will run the `python.exe` that was most recently installed.

- If you `pip install` an executable Python script like `black`, running `black` will start from the top of the list and run the first `Scripts\black` found.

- You will also have the Python Launcher, which you run with `py` at the command line.

If, however, you install Python by downloading and running `.exe` files from [Download Python | Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/), none of these `Python\Python3n\` or `Python\Python3n\Scripts` entries will be added to your path.

- Running `python` from the command line will launch the Microsoft Store, offering to let you download and install the "missing" Python executable.

- Running a pip-installed script will give you an error message: `The term 'black' is not recognized`.

- You will only have the Python Launcher in your path.

To use the Python Launcher ...

- Run `py` to run the latest Python version.

- Run `py -3.11` to run another version.

- Run `py -m black` to run black from the Scripts folder of the latest Python version.

- Run `py -3.11 -m black` to run black from the Scripts folder of another Python version.

- To run another version by default, create a new User Environment Variable, `PY_PYTHON` and set the value to the default you'd like to run. For example, `3.11`.

- `python` will run as expected from inside a virtual environment.

I prefer the Python-Launcher-only setup, because `python` will *only* work from inside a virtual environment. So, any script you set up to run `python` will only work from a virtual environment, and you can run the latest version from inside a virtual environment by running 'py'.

To accomplish this with a winget install, delete all the `Python\Python3.n` and `Python.n\Scripts` entries from your Path environment variable.

## Older Python Versions

Having the exact Python versions you intend to support installed on your machine is less important than it used to be, because we can test whatever versions we like with continuous integration. So, when it comes to older versions of Python, you don't *have* to compile the latest security release.

If you visit [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/), you will see more recent minor versions of older major versions. For instance, right now, winget installs 3.8.10. The latest (source-only) security release for Python 3.8 is 3.8.20. If you navigate to the install page for one of these source-only releases, you will see a note like this one:

> **No installers**

> According to the release calendar specified in [PEP 569](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0569/), Python 3.8 is now in the "security fixes only" stage of its life cycle: 3.8 branch only accepts security fixes and releases of those are made irregularly in source-only form until October 2024. Python 3.8 isn't receiving regular bug fixes anymore, and binary installers are no longer provided for it. **Python 3.8.10** was the last full _bugfix release_ of Python 3.8 with binary installers.

... which will direct you to the latest binary (which is probably the binary winget installed). If you're not comfortable *not* having the latest security releases for these older versions, you can just not install those at all and rely on ci for your tests. For what it's worth, my brother works at a company running Python 2.7 in 2024.

# Install Git

```powershell
winget install Git.Git --source winget
```

## Configure Git from PowerShell

Open PowerShell and run the following commands:

```powershell
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global core.editor "'C:\Program Files\Vim\vim91\vim.exe' -f -i NONE"
git config --global merge.tool vimdiff
git config --global diff.tool vimdiff
git config --global core.excludesFile "$Env:USERPROFILE\.gitignore"
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

Don't let the `--global` flag misinform you. These are settings for one user. These commands update a file in your home directory called `.gitconfig`. You can edit this file later or re-run the commands if you don't like what I've put here, but these are the standard settings for Vim users.

If you prefer, you can use `gvimdiff` instead of `vimdiff` for git tools. GVim is a little quicker on Windows than Vim through PowerShell. But usually you're working in Git through the terminal, and your heaviest "tool" usage will be opening up a quick instance for commit messages.

You can also name your default branch whatever you like. If you don't configure it here, you'll get the default `master`. GitHub uses `main`, so if you're using GitHub, you'll save a bit of work by matching what they use there.

### Other Things That Come With Git

The installer will add `git` to your "System environment" Path (not your "User variables" Path).

The Git installer also provides Curl and Bash. Curl will be on your path for plugins like [vim-instant-markdown](https://github.com/instant-markdown/vim-instant-markdown). You can add bash to your path or just create an alias in your PowerShell profile. It's not necessary for Vim, but it's convenient and already installed if you know Bash. Add this to your PowerShell profile.

```powershell
Set-Alias -Name bash -Value 'C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe'
```

# Install Ripgrep

"Grepping" is a big part of navigating through projects. In Windows, Vim will try to use a grep alternative. I don't remember the name. It works in cmd, but it freezes PowerShell, so we don't want it. Ripgrep is a nice alternative.

```powershell
winget install BurntSushi.ripgrep.MSVC --source winget
```

## Tell Vim to use Ripgrep

Add the following to your `~\vimfiles\vimrc` file. This will tell Vim to use Ripgrep when you use the `:grep` command.

```vim
if has("windows")
	if executable('rg')
		set grepprg=rg\ --vimgrep\ --no-heading
	else
		echoerr "rg not found. Install ripgrep to use :grep"
	endif
endif
```

Once you get everything set up, consider the [ctrl-sf](https://github.com/dyng/ctrlsf.vim) plugin, which will make use of your newly installed and nicely linked ripgrep.

# Install Lua

This step is optional. Lua is required for a few Vim plugins, which you may or may not want to use.

In PowerShell, run

```powershell
winget install DEVCOM.Lua --source winget
```

This will install the file you need (`lua54.dll`) to

```
~\AppData\Local\Programs\Lua\bin\lua54.dll
```

## Tell Vim Where to find Lua

Edit `~\vimfiles\vimrc` and add the following:

```vim
if has("windows")
	var local_programs = expand('$HOME/AppData/Local/Programs')
	execute 'set luadll=' .. local_programs .. '/Lua/bin/lua54.dll'
endif
```

run

```vim
:lua print("test")
```

to make sure everything is set up correctly. As with Python discussed previously, Vim will probably find your Lua without adding this line to the vimrc, but making it explicit can save surprises later on.

# Install Node

This step is optional. If you need Node for [copilot.vim](https://github.com/github/copilot.vim) or another plugin, this is a good time to install it. There's not much to it, but it is a JavaScript runtime environment, and some people don't want that weight. Unless you're coming from something extraordinarily light, the editor you were using most likely installed Node without asking you. Your choice.

```powershell
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS --source winget
```

You run type

```powershell
node -v
```

to check the install.

# Gvim Fullscreen

This step is optional, but if you dislike the toolbar's intruding into your immersive coding experience, you might not feel that way. This executable will allow you to fullscreen gVim.

- Compile from source: [https://github.com/movsb/gvim_fullscreen](https://github.com/movsb/gvim_fullscreen) ... or download [https://github.com/movsb/gvim_fullscreen/releases](https://github.com/movsb/gvim_fullscreen/releases).

- Copy gvimfullscreen.dll to `~/vimfiles/`.

## Tell Vim Where to Find the DLL

Add the following line to your vimrc.

```vim
g:GvimFullscreenDll = $MYVIMDIR .. 'gvim_fullscreen.dll'
if filereadable(g:GvimFullscreenDll)
	inoremap <C-F11> <Esc>:call libcallnr(g:GvimFullscreenDll, 'ToggleFullscreen', 0)<cr>
	noremap <C-F11> :call libcallnr(g:GvimFullscreenDll, 'ToggleFullscreen', 0)<cr>
	inoremap <C-F12> <Esc>:call libcallnr(g:GvimFullscreenDll, 'ToggleTransparency', '255,180')<cr>
	noremap <C-F12> :call libcallnr(g:GvimFullscreenDll, 'ToggleTransparency', '255,180')<cr>
endif
```

Now you can fullscreen gVim with `Ctrl+F11` and toggle transparency with `Ctrl+F12`. I always thought transparency was kind of tasteless, but I've found it nice for re-typing text from a PDF or other source.

For what it's worth, PowerShell will fullscreen Vim when you press `F11` at the cost of stealing this mapping from [vimspector](https://github.com/puremourning/vimspector).

# Install Visual Studio Build Tools

This step is optional. It's a fairly big install, but you will need this for some Python libraries like [llama_index](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index). If you're into things like that, you're going to need it at some point. You can start off by running

```powershell
winget install Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.BuildTools --source winget
```

This takes several minutes, but only installs the Visual Studio Installer. Once that's done, run the Visual Studio Installer from the Windows menu.

- Click 'Modify'.

- Select "Desktop development with C++".

- Click 'Modify' again.

You could *probably* go into "Individual Components" and install "C++ CMake tools for Windows" and "Windows 11 SDK" only, but the entire "Workload" is only 1.75GB and it's not worth the hassle to figure out what you need and what you don't.

There's also a way, I'm sure to [Use command-line parameters to install Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/use-command-line-parameters-to-install-visual-studio?view=vs-2022#use-winget-to-install-or-modify-visual-studio), but I'm not too proud to use the gui installer.

# Install Lazygit

This step is optional, but [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/) is fun and cool and useful. Like all Git interfaces, it's got [issues](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/issues)—as I write this, 666 open issues—but don't let the open issues put you off. As I said (and if you'll excuse a little fun with the coincidence), it's *the nature of the beast*—which may be a big part of the reason you're installing Vim in the first place (fewer interfaces).

```powershell
winget install JesseDuffield.lazygit --source winget
```

Close and restart your Windows Terminal, navigate to a Git project, and type `lazygit` to have a look.

## difftastic

Lazygit can be enhanced with [Difftastic, a structural diff (wilfred.me.uk)](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/), a Git diff viewer that will suppress many formatting-only diffs.

```powershell
winget install Wilfred.difftastic --source winget
```

Tell Lazygit to use  [Difftastic](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/) by opening your Lazygit config

```powershell
vim $env:LOCALAPPDATA\lazygit\config.yml
```

... and adding

```yaml
git:
  paging:
    externalDiffCommand: difft --color=always --display=inline --syntax-highlight=off
```

# Install Vim Plugins

Vim comes with [package support](https://vim-jp.org/vimdoc-en/repeat.html#packages), but not a package *manager*. I won't go into the nuances of that distinction. For now, it's easier to use a package manager, and you have plenty of choices.

We'll install [minpac](https://vim-jp.org/vimdoc-en/repeat.html#packages), because it's simple and easy to install.

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/k-takata/minpac.git $env:USERPROFILE\vimfiles\pack\minpac\opt\minpac
```

Use the command above, not the `git clone` command from the GitHub page, because `%USERPROFILE%` doesn't mean anything to PowerShell.

Now, add this to your `vimrc` file.

```vim
def PackInit(): void
	packadd minpac

	minpac#init()
	minpac#add('k-takata/minpac', {'type': 'opt'})
enddef

command! PackUpdate source $MYVIMRC | PackInit() | minpac#update()
command! PackClean  source $MYVIMRC | PackInit() | minpac#clean()
command! PackStatus packadd minpac | minpac#status()
```

Save and `:source %` your `vimrc` file, then `:PackUpdate` to check that everything is working.

## Plugin Configuration

Some of the plugins we'll install offer quite a bit of configuration, and we'll need to source that configuration before loading our plugins when we start Vim. For those reasons, we'll put plugin configuration in a separate file to keep it from overwhelming our `vimrc`.

Add this to your vimrc:

```vim
source $MYVIMDIR/plugin_config.vim
```

Create this new plugin config:

```vim
:e $MYVIMDIR\plugin_config.vim
```

And add this function:

```vim
vim9script

def HasPlugin(name: string): bool
	# Search for directory in Vim pack directory.
	#
	# If found, return true
	# If not found, print a warning and return false

	var plugin_roots = [
		$MYVIMDIR .. '/pack/minpac/start/',
		$MYVIMDIR .. '/pack/minpac/opt/'
	]
	var has_plugin = v:false
	for plugin_root in plugin_roots
		has_plugin = has_plugin || finddir(plugin_root .. name) != ''
	endfor
	if ! has_plugin
		echo finddir(plugin_roots[0] .. name)
		echo 'Cannot find plugin ' .. name .. '. Skipping configuration.'
	endif
	return has_plugin
enddef
```

We will use this function to only load configuration when a plugin is found and print a warning if we try to configure a plugin that is not found. That's getting our hands slightly dirtier than we need to, but it's a good practice to prevent "plugin config cruft", especially when you're just starting off and wanting to try out a lot of plugins.

# Vim LSP and Completion

We'll take LSP and completion in one bite, because the plugins are from the same author.

Add these plugins to the `PackInit` function you just created in your `vimrc`.

```vim
	# -------- everything needed for lsp and completion
	minpac#add('prabirshrestha/vim-lsp')
	minpac#add('mattn/vim-lsp-settings')
	minpac#add('prabirshrestha/asyncomplete.vim')
	minpac#add('prabirshrestha/asyncomplete-lsp.vim')
```

Save your `vimrc` then run `:PackUpdate` to install the plugins. We're going to configure it before we test it, because I don't care for the default server installed for Python files.

Add this to `~/vimfiles/plugin_config.vim`:

```vim
if HasPlugin("vim-lsp")
	def OnLspBufferEnabled(): void
		setlocal omnifunc=lsp#complete
		setlocal signcolumn=yes
		if exists('+tagfunc') | setlocal tagfunc=lsp#tagfunc | endif
		nmap <buffer> gd <plug>(lsp-definition)
		nmap <buffer> gs <plug>(lsp-document-symbol-search)
		nmap <buffer> gS <plug>(lsp-workspace-symbol-search)
		nmap <buffer> gr <plug>(lsp-references)
		nmap <buffer> gi <plug>(lsp-implementation)
		nmap <buffer> <leader>gt <plug>(lsp-type-definition)
		nmap <buffer> <leader>rn <plug>(lsp-rename)
		nmap <buffer> [g <plug>(lsp-previous-diagnostic)
		nmap <buffer> ]g <plug>(lsp-next-diagnostic)
		nmap <buffer> K <plug>(lsp-hover)

		g:lsp_format_sync_timeout = 1000
		autocmd! BufWritePre *.rs,*.go call execute('LspDocumentFormatSync')
	enddef

	augroup lsp_install
		au!
		# call OnLspBufferEnabled (set the lsp shortcuts) when an lsp server
		# is registered for a buffer.
		autocmd User lsp_buffer_enabled call OnLspBufferEnabled()
	augroup END

	# show error information on statusline, no virtual text
	g:lsp_diagnostics_echo_cursor = 1
	g:lsp_diagnostics_virtual_text_enabled = 0
	g:lsp_settings_filetype_python = ['pyright-langserver']
endif
```

That's quite a lot of text, but it is copied almost directly from [the GitHub README](https://github.com/prabirshrestha/vim-lsp).  This configuration should give you a nice idea of what the LSP is capable of and make things pretty intuitive. Not every language server will have the entire Language Server Protocol defined. So don't expect every `vim-lsp` command to work for every language server.

## Install a Language Server

Open a Python file, and you should see this text on the bottom of you gVim window:

```
Please do: LspInstallServer to enable Language Server pyright-langserver
```

Do as it says, run `:LspInstallServer`, and `vim-lsp` will install the pyright language server at

```
~\AppData\Local\vim-lsp-settings\servers\pyright-langserver
```

You will see a similar prompt the next time you open a Vim file and the next time you open a json file and the next time you open a toml file. If there is a language server available for a filetype, `vim-lsp` will prompt you to install it.

[prabirshrestha/vim-lsp](https://github.com/prabirshrestha/vim-lsp), [mattn/vim-lsp-settings](https://github.com/mattn/vim-lsp-settings), [prabirshrestha/asyncomplete.vim](https://github.com/prabirshrestha/asyncomplete.vim), and [prabirshrestha/asyncomplete-lsp.vim](https://github.com/prabirshrestha/asyncomplete-lsp.vim) have plenty of configuration options to explore. Read through their documentation as time permits. For now, let's just configure asyncomplete.vim. This is the usually expected "tab to complete".

```vim
if HasPlugin("asyncomplete.vim")
	inoremap <expr> <Tab>   pumvisible() ? "\<C-n>" : "\<Tab>"
	inoremap <expr> <S-Tab> pumvisible() ? "\<C-p>" : "\<S-Tab>"
	# enter always enters, will not autocomplete.
	inoremap <expr> <cr> pumvisible() ? asyncomplete#close_popup() .. "\<cr>" : "\<cr>"
endif
```

# Vim Artificial Intelligence

These services cost money.

Return again to the `PackInit` function in your `vimrc` and add two more plugins.

```vim
	# -------- ai completion and chat
	minpac#add('github/copilot.vim')
	minpac#add('madox2/vim-ai', {do: '!py -m pip install "openai>=0.27"'})
```

Have a close look at the second line. [Minpac](https://github.com/k-takata/minpac) will install the `openai` library in whatever Python Vim is using. You may be able to avoid that, but you're going to need a more elaborate hook and some configuration elsewhere. That's up to you, but I wanted to draw your attention to it.

Run `PackUpdate` again to install these plugins. In this instance, I will refer you to the plugin pages for instructions on registering for these services and setting the required environment variables. The instructions on each are simple and clear. I couldn't improve them.

- [github/copilot.vim](https://github.com/github/copilot.vim)

- [madox2/vim-ai](https://github.com/madox2/vim-ai)

Each provides several commands you can type at the command line or create a mapping for. That is the usual process in Vim: review the 100s of available commands and create mappings for the ones you use most frequently. You can browse these commands by typing `:Copilot<space><tab>` or `:AI<tab>` in Vim.

Copilot is useable without mappings or commands, but I want to give you just enough mappings to make Vim-AI simple to use. Type `:AIChat<enter>` to start an AI chat. This is a normal buffer, so when you type `Enter`, you will insert a new line, not submit a query. To submit a query, you will need to run the command `:AIChat` again. That will be our one and only mapping in this section. Add this to `~\vimfiles\plugin_congfig.vim`.

```vim
if HasPlugin("vim-ai")
    # trigger chat or submit query
    inoremap <S-Enter> <Esc>:AIChat<CR>
    nnoremap <S-Enter> :AIChat<CR>
	xnoremap <S-Enter> :AIChat<CR>
endif
```

# Vim Snippets

Once again, return to the `PackInit` function in your `vimrc`. Add this:

```vim
	# -------- snippets
	minpac#add('SirVer/ultisnips')
```

Don't forget to run `:PackUpdate` and restart Vim to make sure the new plugin directory is sourced.

Add some mappings in your `~\vimfiles\plugin_config.vim` file.

```vim
if HasPlugin("ultisnips")
	g:UltiSnipsExpandTrigger = "<C-l>"
	g:UltiSnipsJumpForwardTrigger = "<C-j>"
	g:UltiSnipsJumpBackwardTrigger = "<C-k>"
endif
```

Now, you'll need some snippets. Plenty of documentation on this if you start at [SirVer/ultisnips: UltiSnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips). Let's walk through a simple example.

## Creating a Snippet

In Windows, you'll need to explicitly create a snippets folder at

```
~\vimfiles\ultisnips
```

Just to see how it works, let's do that with Vim's `netrw` file browser.

- type `:Ex<enter>`

- press `d`

- type `ultisnips<enter>`

- type `:bd<enter>` to exit netrw

Now, UltiSnips will recognize this as your snippets directory. Open a Python file. If you don't have one handy, just `:e temp.py`. From the Python file, enter `:UltiSnipsEdit`. UltiSnips will open a file at

```
~\vimfiles\ultisnips\python.snippets
```

Enter this:

```vim
snippet docmod "module docstring" b
"""$1

:author: Your Name Here
:created: `!v strftime("%Y-%m-%d")`
"""
$2
```

Save, return to your Python file, and try out the snippet using the mappings you defined in this section. Type `docmod<C-l>`.

# Vim Debugging

Vim uses the same debugging engine as VS Code and probably several others. To use it, you'll need a plugin and a json configuration.

Return to the `PackInit` function in your `vimrc`. Add this:

```vim
	# -------- debugging
 	minpac#add('puremourning/vimspector', {do: '!py -m pip install setuptools'})
```

Don't forget to run `:PackUpdate` and restart Vim to make sure the new plugin directory is sourced.

Select a set of mappings in `~\vimfiles\plugin_config.vim` file.

```vim
if HasPlugin("vimspector")
	g:vimspector_enable_mappings = 'HUMAN'
	g:vimspector_base_dir = $MYVIMDIR .. 'pack\minpac\start\vimspector'
endif
```

### vimspector.json

Vimspector will need a configuration file. Once you get accustomed to reading and editing this file, you will probably want to shape it in different ways for each project. I keep a template `.vimspector.json` file in each project directory. If I make changes that I want to keep, I commit `.vimspector.json`, otherwise I just copy it in again if I delete and re-clone my local project directory.

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://puremourning.github.io/vimspector/schema/vimspector.schema.json",
    "configurations": {
		"run": {
			"adapter": "debugpy",
            "configuration": {
                "name": "run this Python file",
                "request": "launch",
                "type": "python",
                "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
                "python": "${workspaceRoot}/venv/Scripts/python.exe",
                "program": "${file}",
                "stopOnEntry": false
            },
			"breakpoints": {
                "exception": {
                    "raised": "N",
                    "caught": "N",
                    "uncaught": "Y",
                    "userUnhandled": "N"
                }
            }
        },
        "run - main.py": {
            "adapter": "debugpy",
            "configuration": {
                "name": "run main.py",
                "request": "launch",
                "type": "python",
                "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
                "python": "${workspaceRoot}/venv/Scripts/python.exe",
                "program": "${workspaceRoot}/path/to/main.py",
                "stopOnEntry": false
            },
            "breakpoints": {
                "exception": {
                    "raised": "N",
                    "caught": "N",
                    "uncaught": "Y",
                    "userUnhandled": "N"
                }
            }
        },
        "test": {
            "adapter": "debugpy",
            "configuration": {
                "name": "run this test file",
                "module": "pytest",
                "type": "python",
                "request": "launch",
                "python": "${workspaceRoot}/venv/Scripts/python.exe",
                "args": [
                    "-q",
                    "${file}"
                ]
            },
            "breakpoints": {
                "exception": {
                    "raised": "N",
                    "caught": "N",
                    "uncaught": "Y",
                    "userUnhandled": "N"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

There's a lot of text in there. You can simplify it, as I have here, by following a few common conventions like always naming your virtual environment folder `venv` and your main Python file `main.py`. Whatever you do, it's going to be a lot of text. If you look at the second configuration, "run main.py", you'll see a simple example of how you might edit your `.vimspector.json`. The value

```json
"program": "${workspaceRoot}/path/to/main.py",
```

... should be the path to a main project file. You can get deep into configuration. Start at [puremourning/vimspector](https://github.com/puremourning/vimspector) and read the documentation when you're ready. For now, you can go a long way just by editing the configuration I've provided.

## run Vimspector

Once you're set up, go to a Python project directory, create a `.vimspector.json` in that directory, open a Python module in Vim, and press `f5` to launch vimspector. Vimspector will prompt you to select a configuration.

```
Which launch configuration?
1: run
2: run - main.py
3: test
```

Select `run` by pressing `1<enter>`, and Vimspector will prompt

```
The specified adapter 'debugpy' is not installed. Would you like to install the following gadgets? debugpy
```

Press Enter, and vimspector will install debugpy for you then launch the vimspector tab. You can experiment with it now, or `:call vimspector#Reset()` to get out and come back later.

# Vim Fuzzy Finding

By now, I suspect you know the steps. Return to the `PackInit` function in your `vimrc`. Add this:

```vim
	# -------- fuzzy finder
	minpac#add('Donaldttt/fuzzyy')
```

Don't forget to run `:PackUpdate` and restart Vim to make sure the new plugin directory is sourced.

`:Fuzz<tab>` to see the commands. The most common may be `:FuzzyyGitFiles`. You likely want a mapping for it. Add this to `~\vimfiles\plugin_config.vim`:

```
vim
if HasPlugin("fuzzyy")
	nnoremap <C-P> :FuzzyGitFiles<CR>
endif
```

Don't expect that to do much right now unless you're in a git directory with `git add`-ed files, but it will help you quickly navigate through your project later on.

Avoid the bad habit of using a fuzzy finder to switch between a handful of files. `:h mark-motions` for the most straightforward way to accomplish that in Vim.

# The Usual Suspects

There are several [Tim Pope](https://github.com/tpope) plugins that could qualify as "the usual suspects". These are so common that it's all-but taken for granted that you have them installed.

```vim
	# -------- the usual suspects
	minpac#add('tpope/vim-dispatch')  # async build
	minpac#add('tpope/vim-fugitive')  # git integration
	minpac#add('tpope/vim-obsession')  # session management
	minpac#add('tpope/vim-commentary')  # commenting
	minpac#add('tpope/vim-surround')  # surround text objects
```

- [vim-dispatch](https://github.com/tpope/vim-dispatch)

- [fugitive.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive)

- [vim-obsession](https://github.com/tpope/vim-obsession)

- [vim-commentary](https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary)

- [surround.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround)

At some point, you'll want to review the documentation for all of these, but the only one we'll rely on for this guide is vim-dispatch.  [vim-dispatch](https://github.com/tpope/vim-dispatch) allows you to `make` (compile) programs asynchronously. This guide is focused on Python dev, and we don't compile Python programs, but we will use vim-dispatch's `Make` command to run `pre-commit` (a common Python tool) asynchronously.

# Vim Configuration

Too many options to discuss, but we'll "scratch the surface" with a few examples.

```vim
:e $MYVIMRC
```

One function, one setting, and one leader mapping.

```vim
def g:RestoreLspHighlights(): void
	# Call if you see errors in elaborate LSP
	# highlighting after changing colorschemes.
    highlight link LspErrorHighlight Error
    highlight link LspWarningHighlight Todo
    highlight link LspInformationHighlight Normal
    highlight link LspHintHighlight Normal
enddef

set number  # turn on line numbers

# remove trailing whitespace
nnoremap <leader>_ :%s/\s\+$//g<CR>
```

These settings and mappings will apply to all filetypes, but can be overwritten with file-specific settings in the `after/ftplugin` folder.

# Set Gvim Guifont

We're going to do some light configuration in gVim, less to configure it, more to walk through a few concepts.

If you are running gVim, gVim will read an additional configuration file, `gvimrc`, after reading you `vimrc`. Open `gvimrc` in gVim.

```powershell
gvim $MYVIMDIR\gvimrc
```

And paste in this content:

```vim
vim9script

# if you can't see the below characters, get a better font
set listchars=tab:→\ ,eol:↵,trail:·,extends:↷,precedes:↶
set fillchars+=vert:│  # for a better looking windows separator
```

The `listchars` value isn't the most important part of your gVim configuration, but we're starting here for a reason. Inside gVim, look at the line beginning with `set listchars` and chances are you won't be able to see all of the characters.

gVim has a menu. Click `Edit > Select Font...` and browse through the available fonts. You  might find a font that shows the characters and looks nice to your tastes, but possibly not.

### install another font

Let's install a nice-looking (to my taste, at least) font with these "extra" characters. To accomplish this, we will install a font for the entire Windows system, then select that font in gVim. Go to [Release dejavu-fonts-2.37 · dejavu-fonts/dejavu-fonts · GitHub](https://github.com/dejavu-fonts/dejavu-fonts/releases/tag/version_2_37), download a zip file, extract the contents, right click on `DejaVuSansMono.ttf`, and install. You will now be able to select `DejaVu Sans Mono` in the gVim font menu.

### setting the guifont

Your font selection has a special name that gVim will understand. You can see it by typing

```vim
:set guifont
```

Now, let's capture the output of `:set guifont`. Open your `gvimrc`, place your cursor on an empty line, and type this command:

```vim
:call append('.', 'set guifont=' .. &guifont)
```

This will insert the following into your `gvimrc`.

```vim
set guifont=DejaVu_Sans_Mono:h10:cANSI:qDRAFT
```

Keep that line in `~/vimfiles/vimrc` and your font selection will persist. If you open gVim on a system without `DejaVu Sans Mono`, gVim will revert to the default font. If you'd like to choose your own fallback, you  can list as many fonts as you like, separated by commas. gVim will start with the first and search for an available font.

```vim
set guifont=Consolas:h10:cANSI:qDRAFT,SimSun-ExtB:h11:cANSI:qDEFAULT,DejaVuSansMono_NFM:h10:cANSI:qDRAFT
```

`:set list!` if you want to see your `listchars` in action. `:set list!` again to turn it off.

## Renderoptions

If you paste the following into Vim (running in PowerShell), you will see what you see in your browser: a colorful Unicode garden.

```vim
# symbols for render test
# 🌸 (U+1F338) 🌼 (U+1F33C) 🌻 (U+1F33B) 🌺 (U+1F33A) 🌹 (U+1F339)
# 🌷 (U+1F337) 💐 (U+1F490) 🌲 (U+1F332) 🌳 (U+1F333) 🌴 (U+1F334)
# 🌵 (U+1F335) 🌿 (U+1F33F) 🌱 (U+1F331) 🍀 (U+1F340) 🍁 (U+1F341)
# 🍂 (U+1F342) 🍃 (U+1F343) 🍎 (U+1F34E) 🍏 (U+1F34F) 🍐 (U+1F350)
# 🍊 (U+1F34A) 🍋 (U+1F34B) 🍌 (U+1F34C) 🍉 (U+1F349) 🍇 (U+1F347)
# 🍓 (U+1F353) 🍒 (U+1F352) 🍑 (U+1F351) 🥝 (U+1F95D) 🍍 (U+1F34D)
# 🥥 (U+1F965) 🍅 (U+1F345) 🍆 (U+1F346) 🥑 (U+1F951) 🥒 (U+1F952)
# 🌽 (U+1F33D) 🥕 (U+1F955) 🥔 (U+1F954) 🧄 (U+1F9C4) 🧅 (U+1F9C5)
```

 If you paste this text into gVim, the result will be considerably less interesting. To get nice, colorful symbols, tell gVim to use the same DirectX rendering as PowerShell. Add this to your `gvimrc`:

```vim
set renderoptions=type:directx,gamma:1.0,geom:0,renmode:5,taamode:1
```

## Window Size

While we're here, let's add another common gVim configuration request. This one is passive, so you won't have any new commands to learn. Add this to your `gvim.vimrc`.

```vim
# open at a useful size
if !exists('g:vimrc_sourced')
	g:vimrc_sourced = 1
    set lines=50
    set columns=120
endif
```

## How do I set the font in Vim?

You don't. Vim will use whatever font you are using in your terminal. You can use the same `listchars` and `fillchars` above and use a font that supports them, or you can use a simpler font for all of your terminal programs and set a simpler `listchars`.

```vim
if has('gui_running')
	source $MYVIMDIR/gvim.vimrc
else
	set listchars=tab:>\ ,trail:-,extends:>,precedes:<,nbsp:+
endif
```

## Fullscreen Gvim

If you followed the earlier instructions to download Gvim Fullscreen, here is the best spot to configure it. Add this to your `~\vimfiles\gvim.vimrc`:

```vim
g:GvimFullscreenDll = $MYVIMDIR .. 'gvim_fullscreen.dll'
if filereadable(g:GvimFullscreenDll)
	inoremap <C-F11> <Esc>:call libcallnr(g:GvimFullscreenDll, 'ToggleFullscreen', 0)<cr>
	noremap <C-F11> :call libcallnr(g:GvimFullscreenDll, 'ToggleFullscreen', 0)<cr>
	inoremap <C-F12> <Esc>:call libcallnr(g:GvimFullscreenDll, 'ToggleTransparency', '255,180')<cr>
	noremap <C-F12> :call libcallnr(g:GvimFullscreenDll, 'ToggleTransparency', '255,180')<cr>
endif
```

# The Vim After Directory

Naturally, Vim doesn't treat every filetype the same. Set specific configuration variables in

```
~\vimfiles\after\ftplugin\
```

If you don't have them yet, create the `after` and `ftplugin` directories.

- `:Ex`

- press `d`

- `after/ftplugin`

```vim
:e $MYVIMDIR\after\ftplugin\python.vim
```

Let's start with some basic PEP-8-ish formatting for Python. Add these lines:

```vim
vim9script

setlocal expandtab  # spaces instead of tabs
setlocal tabstop=4  # a tab = four spaces
setlocal shiftwidth=4  # number of spaces for auto-indent
setlocal softtabstop=4  # a soft-tab of four spaces
setlocal autoindent  # turn on auto-indent

setlocal colorcolumn=89  # max cols in black is 88
setlocal textwidth=85  # wrapping for gq
setlocal formatoptions-=t  # do not autowrap text
```

You may prefer to put some of these in your global `vimrc` so they apply to all files. If you're keeping them here, use `setlocal` and instead of `set` so they *stop* applying when you edit something that *isn't* a Python file.

As an example, let's create a map to run our test suite in Vim's integrated terminal. Notice the `<buffer>` flag. Like `setlocal`, `<buffer>` keeps configuration local to a file. In this case, every file with a *python* filetype.

```vim
nnoremap <buffer> <leader>e :update<CR>:vert term python -m pytest<t_ku>
```

This mapping will

- save the current buffer

- start a command with `:!python -m pytest`

- press up to reload the previous `:!python -m pytest` command

- then nothing

The mapping will not run the command, but will wait for you to

- press Enter

- navigate through the history of commands starting with `:!python -m pytest` by using the arrow keys

There are several ways to navigate command history in Vim. This is just one given as an example.

## Asynchronous pre-commit

Set up a mapping to run `pre-commit` asynchronously in Vim's `quickfix` window. To do this, you will define a compiler in `$MYVIMDIR/compiler`.

- open a terminal and cd to `~\vimfiles`

- `:Ex`

- `d`

- `compiler`

```vim
:e $MYVIMDIR\compiler\precommit.vim
```

Add this content to `precommit.vim`:

```vim
vim9script

CompilerSet makeprg=pre-commit\ run\ -a

# errorformats:
# 1. ruff
# 2. mypy
# 3. pyright
CompilerSet errorformat=%f:%l:%c:\ %m,%f:%l:\ %m,%f:%l:%c\ -\ %m,%f:
```

Now add the mapping to the Python ftplugin.

```vim
e: $MYVIMDIR\after\ftplugin\python.vim
```

Add this content to `ftplugin/python.vim`:

```vim
compiler precommit
nmap <buffer> <leader>l :update<CR>:vert Make<CR>:update<CR>
imap <buffer> <leader>l <ESC>:update<CR>:vert Make<CR>:update<CR>
```

Now you can press `<leader>l` from a Python module to run your pre-commit hooks. This requires [vim-dispatch](https://github.com/tpope/vim-dispatch).

## configure the aichat window

```vim
:e $MYVIMDIR\after\ftplugin\aichat.vim
```

```vim
vim9script

setlocal wrap
setlocal linebreak
```

# More

At this point, *your OS and various APIs* are a high-functioning IDE. You may still want to put some work into your editor, but that will be the easy part. Vim has great documentation available with `:h topic` if you know what you're looking for, and `:FuzzyHelps` will help if you do not.

It's a common thing to commit your Vim configuration and even to keep it public. Here's mine: [ShayHill/vimfiles](https://github.com/ShayHill/vimfiles) Here's famous Vimmer Tim Pope's config: [tpope/dotfiles](https://github.com/tpope/dotfiles). Remember that it's never finished. Enjoy the process.
